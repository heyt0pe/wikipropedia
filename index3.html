                    <p>Tom and his staff handed my estate plan and also did our Company policy and procedure plan.

                    <p>Although this particular business venture did not pan out, I learned that Tom is very good as a
                        lawyer, and as a business partner. His communication skills and strategies are excellent. Very
                        approachable.</p>

                    <p>Tom and I have worked with many common clients over the past 15+ years in the areas of asset
                        protection, estate planning, real estate, business planning, etc. He is an excellent attorney
                        who thinks outside the box. He can take the complex and make it simple which is important in
                        communicating with clients. I recommend Tom in any of the areas mentioned above.</p>

                    <p>Tom has been our go to attorney for real estate and creative
                        thinking for many years. I have recommended him time and time
                        again and he has over delivered each and every time. I would
                        highly recommend working with Tom in any capacity you can. Also

                        Tom has a great sense of humor!</p>

                    <p>I endorse this lawyer's work as a business and real estate advisor. Tom has been a good sounding
                        board for me and he doesn't hesitate to generously offer insightful valuable suggestions. Tom is
                        a good communicator and super-networker. He embraces new technology (like LinkedIn) and is very
                        personable to work with. Tom has been teaching business law at Dakota County Technical College
                        in addition to practicing law at BenePartum Law Group PA. Jeff Peterson, Commercial Partners

                    <p>Tom does a great job of explaining asset protection, estate planning and income tax planning
                        strategies to non-professionals. Rather than threatening a financial advisor's relationship with
                        their clients, he actually makes the relationship deeper and broader. Tom credits me to my
                        client for recognizing opportunities for them that are outside my relationship (i.e. legal
                        issues, tax savings opportunities) and, nearly always, he generates a return on investment in
                        legal fees for my client. He believes that business owners and real estate investors should
                        consider obtaining diversification by harvesting wealth, diversifying savings with non-privately
                        held securities and does a great job of explaining the benefits of permanent insurance to these
                        entrepreneurs. I think any financial advisor should consider including Tom's services with
                        existing clients and serious prospects.</p>

                    <p>I have worked with Tom over the past 10 yrs with many mutual clients. Over the past 14 - 15
                        months have saved over 7 figures of income taxes with Tom's various planning strategies. Yes,
                        Tom is an attorney that charges per hour for his service, but without exception has always been
                        benefit tenfold or more of the legal fees charged.</p>

                    <p>Tom has done an excellent job of helping several of my clients with inventive, thorough and
                        timely results. He is a very valuable collaborative partner working with business owners that
                        desire to think long term & maximize their life's work.



                        He is especially effective when working within a multidisciplinary team of advisors when
                        financial & tax stakes are high. He is very aware of the personal and emotional issues closely
                        held business/property owners experience.

                    <p>Tom Fafinski is one of those lawyers that you meet and when you walk away from the meeting you
                        can't help but say, "Let's make sure he's always on our side and not the other." Professional,

                    <p>Tom is a brilliant attorney who continually thinks outside the box.
                        The difference between Tom and other high profile attorneys is

                        that Tom cares.</p>

                        top attorney's. With my 30+ years of real estate Brokerage
                        experience, Tom Fafinski is a recognized expert who I will continue
                        to use for legal assistance but I'm also very happy to recommend

                    <p>As an attorney, Tom is second to none. He gets it. He understands
                        that protecting the client does not mean you squash the deal. Tom
                        is a deal guy. Real estate investment and relationships round out
                        his strong points. I highly recommend Tom. I would not, however,

                        bet too much money on the golf course with him.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>Thomas M. Fafinski is co-founder of Virtus Law PLLC, a 7 attorney firm in Minnesota which simulates a
                general counsel’s office for hundreds of privately-held businesses and real estate interests. Thomas
                works or leads litigation, business transactions and planning departments of Virtus Law PLLC’s services.
                He graduated 13thin his class at William Mitchell College of Law, cum laude, in January of 1991 and is
                also a cum laude graduate of the College of St. Thomas where he secured a bachelor’s degree in Business
                Administration and Finance.<br />Tom founded Fafinski & Wallrich, PA, which grew to a medium sized law
                firm of 10 attorneys. When approached for a second time to merge practices with a large downtown law
                firm, Fafinski’s group remained independent. Eventually, this group was purchased by an investor
                attorney from a large law firm and he continued as an employee for roughly 5 years. Tom had the
                opportunity to start Virtus Law PLLC with his partner, Nathan Nelson, in 2010. While practicing under 3
                banners over 24 years, Fafinski has continually served those with an interest in privately-held
