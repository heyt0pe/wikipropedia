            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>Dean R. Hedeker is a leading Chicago-area authority on estate and tax planning, business law, and
                investments. Dean has more than 37 years' experience helping business owners and families grow, protect,
                and pass on their hard-earned money through tax planning, estate planning, and investment management
                services. Over the past 10 years alone, Dean has created more than 2,000 estate plans and every year he
                handles more than 300 complex tax returns for business and families. Currently, he manages the wealth of
                more than 80 hard-working families. Dean is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and has a Bachelor's
                degree and a Juris Doctor-both with highest honors-from DePaul University. He is licensed to practice
                law in Illinois and Pennsylvania. He is also a Registered Financial Consultant (RFC) and has served as
                an education adviser, Fellow and most recently appointed to Board of Governors of the American Academy
                of Estate Planning Attorneys. Dean has made presentations at more than 500 events attended by legal,
                financial, and healthcare professionals and has been a featured source for WBBM's Noon Business Hour,
                WGN Radio, WLS Chicago, and CBS 2 Chicago. He has also co-authored three additional books on estate
                planning. He is principal at Dean R. Hedeker, Ltd., and principal of Hedeker Wealth Management Group,
                LLC.<br />Most recently Dean co-authored the book CUT YOUR TAX IN 2010 whichprovides the straight talk
                on why poor estate and retirement planning can cost you dearly. Plus, the book provides insights on the
                capital gains trap, the tax benefits of living trusts, and other tax-saving tips. Many of the techniques
                discussed are the building blocks of a good estate plan. Without an estate plan, you’re paying too much
                in taxes on your assets right now. And your family will pay dearly—maybe even more than they can
                afford—after you’re gone. To learn more about this book go to http://www.cutyourtaxbook.com/</p>
