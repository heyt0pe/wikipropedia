                    <p>I had a fantastic experience. My Chapter 13 case is going as well as it can and I feel totally
                        comfortable with Mr. Gustafson and his staff. He is very knowledgeable and expert with all of
                        the questions that I ask. He really has this field down and we are have been calmed repeatedly
                        through the hectic process of bankruptcy. I was terrified when we began but as Mr. Gustafson
                        walked me through the whole process, and things happened just as he said, I grew more and more
                        confident and I'm not afraid anymore. My fresh start is an enormous relief and now I can't
                        imagine my life without Mr. Gustafson and without the relief from my creditors that the
                        bankruptcy brought. I highly recommend Carl for your case if you are considering bankruptcy but
                        worried like I was.</p>
