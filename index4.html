          <p>Craig helped me with a very different multi jurisdiction custody battle. I met with several other attorneys
            before Craig and even hired one. None of them though I really had a chance. Craig came in and was very
            professional and organized and k ew exactly what was needed to win. Not only did he delivery what he said he
            would he greatly exceeded my expectations. I wound up winning custody of my son from his mother and brought
            him back to Ohio. I was able to get to know Craig on a personal level. He took time to meet with me and my
            family to better understand this case. I would highly highly recommend Craig. He will leaving you feeling
            like you not only higheded a good attorney but you made a good friend. </p>

          <p>Divorce can be a lengthy, scary, and difficult process. My first divorce team (with a different firm) sadly
            proved all those points. When I met with Craig and his team halfway through the divorce process, he asked
            all the difficult questions with compassion and navigated quickly though the final steps. Everyone was
            thorough and anticipated any of my personal concerns down to new health insurance information that I had no
            idea to use while in divorce-limbo. The team never worked FOR me, but rather worked WITH me and shared their
            time-tested best practices while preparing for the court date... including preparation and organizing of all
            the information and documents necessary to see the process to the end. Communication was immediate, concise,
            and clear despite a system that prides itself on legalese. Throughout our meetings both in his office and in
            court, it was obvious that Craig's friendly demeanor and experience had the respect of his colleagues and
            even asking for advice while sitting in court. The day of, Craig calmed me down and I knew the good/bad/ugly
            scenarios to expect... and although (thankfully) my divorce ended easily, I know without a doubt that if it
            ended any other way Craig would work with me on the next steps to take. I am soooo pleased with Craig and
            his team's professionalism, competence, and compassion that I have ALREADY recommended him to another
            friend.</p>

      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>Craig Weaver is an outdoor enthusiast with a spirit for adventure and a reputation for being a tenacious and
        effective litigator for his clients in the courtroom. Practicing law in Truckee, Lake Tahoe, Reno, and the Lost
        Sierra, Craig is an experienced litigator and transactional attorney. Craig takes pride in his attention to
        detail and in fashioning the best result for each of his clients while always being mindful of each client’s
        individual needs. Craig is a Certified Family Law Specialist, certified by the State Bar of California Board of
        Legal Specialization. After devoting nearly a decade to practicing law almost exclusively in high-conflict and
        high-asset family law litigation matters, Craig has transitioned his practice to have more of an emphasis on
        corporate and business law matters. Craig is able to quickly recognize and define the issues his clients face
        and then work with his clients to develop strategies on how to best deal with each individual issue. While the
        legal process may often seem daunting and intimidating, Craig takes pride in helping his clients understand the
        process and guiding them through to a favorable resolution.<br />In 2018, Craig was selected as one of the Top
        10 Family Law Attorneys in California by the American Jurist Institute. In 2017 & 2018, he was named as a
        “Rising Star” in Northern California by Thomson Reuters Super Lawyers and was also recognized as being one of
        the 10 Best Family Law Attorneys in Northern California for Client Satisfaction by the American Institute of
        Legal Counsel. In 2017, Craig was recognized as being one of the top 40 attorneys under the age of 40 in
        Northern California by The National Advocates, and in 2015 he was named as one of the Top Family Law Lawyers in
        Sacramento by Sacramento Magazine, received the Avvo Client’s Choice Award, and was nominated as a National
        Lawyer of Distinction in Family Law. A year earlier in 2014, Craig received an Honor Advocate award from the
        American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers of Northern California for his performance at the Northern California
        Trial Practicum in San Francisco.<br />Craig works with many local business owners to help them establish, grow,
        and protect their businesses, and he also has considerable experience with highly complex, high-dollar, and
        high-asset divorce cases, often including issues concerning the valuation of family owned businesses.
        Additionally, he has substantial experience with multi-jurisdictional cases involving complex matters concerning
        the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (“UCCJEA”) and Uniform Interstate Family Support Act
        (“UIFSA”). Craig believes legal matters are a three-step process that require patience and open communication
        between an attorney and client in order to be successful. He believes the first step is understanding the ground
        rules. The second step is developing a plan of action, and the third step is properly implementing the plan.
        When asked about the legal process, Craig said, “There are times when it will seem like the opposing party is
        not willing to negotiate and there will be no way to avoid going before a judge to have a matter resolved.
        Always take the high-road, be patient, be open to negotiations, and if the other party is being unreasonable
        then the judge will likely see that, too.”<br />As a litigator, Craig has established a successful track-record,
        including helping to facilitate favorable settlements for his clients. He has successfully argued cases and
        motions before the Superior Courts of Placer, Nevada, El Dorado, Sacramento, Plumas, Sierra, Alpine, Tuolumne,
        San Francisco, Sonoma, Alameda, Yolo, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Riverside, Orange, and Los Angeles counties in
        the State of California, in the Eastern District of California, as well as in district court in Kootenai County,
        Idaho.<br />Being a native of North Idaho and Eastern Washington, Craig received his Juris Doctorate (J.D.)
        degree from the University of Idaho in 2009. He also received a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Business
        with an emphasis in Marketing and a minor in Public Relations from the same institution. Craig graduated magna
        cum laude near the top of his class and served as the president and executive director of various organizations
        while pursuing his undergraduate degree. In addition, in 2004, Craig was named the Outstanding Business Student
        of the Year by the prestigious Beta Gamma Sigma honor society, the business equivalent to Phi Beta Kappa for
        liberal arts and science graduates, and is a recipient of the University of Idaho Alumni Award for
        Excellence.<br />Prior to law school and before joining MOBO, Craig served as the director of marketing for an
        international travel company based out of El Dorado Hills, California, and also gained international experience
        working as a program director in the Bahamas, Mexico, and Canada for WorldPass Travel Group, LLC & International
        Student Tours, Inc. During law school, Craig gained substantial experience as a legal intern at Paine Hamblen,
        LLP, based out of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, and Beck & Poorman, LLC, based out of Hayden, Idaho, both highly
        respected firms in North Idaho and Eastern Washington. As a third year law student, Craig gained notoriety by
        successfully arguing a case before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco while serving as a member
        of the University of Idaho Legal Aid Clinic. Upon completion of his law degree, Craig returned to Northern
        California and founded American Dream Management, LLC, a California limited liability company providing
        management services to common-interest development community associations. Soon thereafter in 2009, Craig began
        practicing law as a solo practitioner before joining Cordell & Cordell, P.C., one of the nation’s largest
        domestic relations litigation law firms, where he served as the lead attorney for the Sacramento office. In
        2014, he joined Bartholomew & Wasznicky, LLP to better serve his clients as part of the most experienced family
        law firm in Northern California, and in 2016 transitioned his practice to Molsby & Bordner, LLP to expand his
        practice base and increase his presence in Truckee, Lake Tahoe, Reno, and the Lost Sierra.<br />In his time away
        from the office, Craig enjoys mountain biking and spending time with his family. He is also an avid alpine skier
        and competitive triathlete and endurance runner having completed Ironman Lake Tahoe, Ironman Canada, Ironman
        Coeur d’Alene, XTERRA Lake Tahoe, XTERRA Tahoe City, and the Big Sur Marathon, among other
        races.<br />Disclaimer: The testimonials and/or endorsements found on this site do not constitute a
